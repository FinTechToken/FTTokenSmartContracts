## Why did we create the Open Utility Token License?
Open source software is free because people develop software without getting paid. Corporate software is expensive and lacks the benefits of community. 

People should get paid for their contributions in a way that keeps the cost to consumers of software low.

The Open Utility Token License is a way to share the benefits of a project with the community of contributors that develops and maintains the project. The Open Utility Token License also keeps software licensing simple and inexpensive to consumers.

People may utilize a project by purchasing the projects utility tokens. Tokens are smart contracts that may be written to implement specific business models. For example; an Utility Token may have an expiration date to implement a subscription based business modal, or an Utility Token may expire after each use, or an Utility Token may grant the holder a perpetual license.

We beleive a project can have two main tokens representing two main stakeholders. The consumers via the Utility Token, and the contributors via a ProjectToken.

The proceeds gained from selling Utility Tokens go via smart contract directly to the contributors to a project via the ProjectTokens. This dramatically lowers costs.
